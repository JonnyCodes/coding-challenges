 * IPv4 Validation
 *

 * For example, 192.0.2.146 is a valid IPv4 address.
 * 
 * Write a function that takes a string as an input
 * return true if it's a IPv4 value
 * return false if it's not a IPv4 value

/**
 * IPv6 Validation
 * 
 * An IPv6 address has the format y:y:y:y:y:y:y:y, where y is called a segment and can be any hexadecimal value between 0 and FFFF.
 * The segments are separated by colons, not periods. An IPv6 address must have eight segments.
 * For example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334 is a valid IPv6 address.
 * 
 * Write a function that takes a string as an input
 * return true if it's a IPv6 value
 * return false if it's not a IPv6 value
