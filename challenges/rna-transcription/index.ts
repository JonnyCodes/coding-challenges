/**
 * RNA Transcription
 * 
 * Write a function that takes an DNA string and transcribes it to an RNA string
 * 
 * Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.
 * The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).
 * The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).
 * 
 * Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:
 * G -> C
 * C -> G
 * T -> A
 * A -> U
